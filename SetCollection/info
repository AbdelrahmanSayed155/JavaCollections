Java HashSet class

Java HashSet class hierarchy
Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet 
class and implements Set interface.

The important points about Java HashSet class are:

HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
HashSet contains unique elements only.


public class HashSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> implements Set<E>, Cloneable, Serializable  

HashSet Methods 
void clear()	It is used to remove all of the elements from this set.
boolean contains(Object o)	It is used to return true if this set contains the specified element.
boolean add(Object o)	It is used to adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present.
boolean isEmpty()	It is used to return true if this set contains no elements.
boolean remove(Object o)	It is used to remove the specified element from this set if it is present.
Object clone()	It is used to return a shallow copy of this HashSet instance: the elements themselves are not cloned.
Iterator iterator()	It is used to return an iterator over the elements in this set.
int size()


   implement code into class using for hashset  {
 ---- public boolean equals(Object obj)
 --- public int hashCode()
}


Java LinkedHashSet class is a Hash table and Linked list implementation of the set interface.
 It inherits HashSet class and implements Set interface.

The important points about Java LinkedHashSet class are:

Contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Provides all optional set operations, and permits null elements.
Maintains insertion order.
Hierarchy of LinkedHashSet class
called hashed becuase it using HashMap object for internally to store it’s elements

The LinkedHashSet class extends HashSet class which implements Set interface. 
The Set interface inherits Collection and Iterable interfaces in hierarchical order.

-----------------
Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage.
 It inherits AbstractSet class and implements NavigableSet interface.
 The objects of TreeSet class are stored in ascending order.

The important points about Java TreeSet class are:

Contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Access and retrieval times are quiet fast.
Maintains ascending order.


hashSet set elemnt by hashvalue so it order o(1)
hashlinkedSet is linkedList have prperty of Set 
treeSet is set and sorting desending
