Java Comparable interface
Java Comparable interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class.
This interface is found in java.lang package and contains only one method named compareTo(Object). 
It provide single sorting sequence only i.e. you can sort the elements on based on single data member only. 
For example it may be rollno, name, age or anything else.
compareTo(Object obj) method
public int compareTo(Object obj): is used to compare the current object with the specified object.

Java Comparator interface
Java Comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class.
This interface is found in java.util package and contains 2 methods compare(Object obj1,Object obj2) and equals(Object element).
It provides multiple sorting sequence i.e. 
you can sort the elements on the basis of any data member, for example rollno, name, age or anything else.

Comparable	Comparator
1) Comparable provides single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of single element such as id or name or price etc.	Comparator provides multiple sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name and price etc.
2) Comparable affects the original class i.e. actual class is modified.	Comparator doesn't affect the original class i.e. actual class is not modified.
3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.	Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
4) Comparable is found in java.lang package.	Comparator is found in java.util package.
5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.	We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List,Comparator) method.
