Java Queue interface orders the element in FIFO(First In First Out) manner. In FIFO, first element is removed first and last element is removed at last

Methods of Java Queue Interface
boolean add(object)	It is used to insert the specified element into this queue and return true upon success.
boolean offer(object)	It is used to insert the specified element into this queue.
Object remove()	It is used to retrieves and removes the head of this queue.
Object poll()	It is used to retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.
Object element()	It is used to retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.
Object peek()	It is used to retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.


PriorityQueue class

The PriorityQueue class provides the facility of using queue. 
But it does not orders the elements in FIFO manner.
 It inherits AbstractQueue class.

Let's see a PriorityQueue example where we are adding books to
 queue and printing all the books. The elements in PriorityQueue
  must be of Comparable type. String and Wrapper classes are Comparable
   by default. To add user-defined objects in PriorityQueue, you need to
    implement Comparable interface
    
    
-----> for queue you must LinkedList or ArrayQueue
